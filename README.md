# Workshop starter project

This repo acts as a starter for modeling in code hands-on.


## Your assignment

Pair up with someone else and **use TDD** red-green-refactor loop to write the code for the assignments. Assignemts will be given by the instructor.

Regularly switch driver and navigator. For example using the [pair programming ping pong pattern](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/ping-pong-programming/).


## Start coding

Create an empty project for yourself, or checkout one of the **branches** below to get a **quick-start project**. There is no code there that you can use â€“ _you have to write your own code today_.

```bash
git checkout kotlin
```

```bash
git checkout java
```

**Tip**: for Kotlin or Java, use [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).
